 <b>Project Name</b>
 
 Nowcasting hospital deaths from  COVID-19 in London

 <b>Tools</b>
 
 Python,R

<b>Analysis Details</b>

• Pre-processing 10000+ death data in R by extracting,transforming and loading data.

• Performed death analysis by building Generalized Additive Model and applying statistical methdology to forcast Covid-19 deaths.

• To improve deaths nowcasting accuracy, built and trained machine learning models such as SARIMAX Model,XGBOOST and NN Model using
Scikit-Learn package in Python to compared different Time Series Prediction output.
 
 <b>Project Outcome</b>
 
 Successfully predicted the number of deaths that occur each day for a given time period in London.
