 Project Name:Nowcasting hospital deaths from  COVID-19 in London

 Tools:Python,R

Analysis Details:

• Pre-processing 10000+ death data in R by extracting,transforming and loading data.

• Performed death analysis by building Generalized Additive Model and applying statistical methdology to forcast Covid-19 deaths.

• To improve deaths nowcasting accuracy, built and trained machine learning models such as SARIMAX Model,XGBOOST and NN Model using
Scikit-Learn package in Python to compared different Time Series Prediction output.
 
 Project Outcome:Successfully predicted the number of deaths that occur each day for a given time period in London.
